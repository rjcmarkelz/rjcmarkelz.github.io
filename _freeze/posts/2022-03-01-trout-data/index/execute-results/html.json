We will take a look using publicly available observation data from the GBIF database. See previous posts [here](/posts/2021-04-26-gbif-miracle-mile-species/) and [here](/posts/2021-05-15-mlk-cycling-nature/) for other examples of species occurrence data.\n\n\nLoad the necessary R libraries.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rgbif)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(leaflet)\n```\n:::\n\n\nPull in the species observation data from GBIF.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrb_trout <- occ_data(scientificName = \"Oncorhynchus mykiss\", hasCoordinate = TRUE, limit = 1000)\nbw_olive <- occ_data(scientificName = \"Baetis tricaudatus\", hasCoordinate = TRUE, limit = 1000)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSubset these datasets for only a few pieces of data.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrb_trout_coords <- rb_trout$data[ , c(\"decimalLongitude\", \"decimalLatitude\",\n\"occurrenceStatus\", \"coordinateUncertaintyInMeters\", \"references\")]\nbw_olive_coords <- bw_olive$data[ , c(\"decimalLongitude\", \"decimalLatitude\",\n\"occurrenceStatus\", \"coordinateUncertaintyInMeters\", \"references\")]\n```\n:::\n\n\nPlot on a map of California.
