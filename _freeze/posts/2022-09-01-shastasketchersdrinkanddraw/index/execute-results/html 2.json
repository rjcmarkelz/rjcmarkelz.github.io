We decided to make our meet-ups a community event once a month hosted at a few businesses in town that sell craft beer. To find out more about upcoming events please visit our group at [Shasta Sketchers](https://www.shastasketchers.com/).\n\nIf you like my sketches you can check out the [sketchbook section](https://www.codymarkelz.art/sketchbook) of my art [portfolio website](https://www.codymarkelz.art/) or follow me on instagram [codymarkelz](https://www.instagram.com/codymarkelz/).\n\nI put together a flier based on some of the live sketches I did at these businesses.\n![](/images/ShastasketchersDrinkAndDrawFinal.png)\n\nHere are some other sketches I made on-sight at [Deadwood Supply Co.](https://www.deadwoodsupply.com/).\n\n![](/images/sketchbook-deadwood-1.jpg)\n\n![](/images/sketchbook-deadwood-2.jpg)\n\n![](/images/sketchbook-deadwood-3.png)\n\n![](/images/sketchbook-deadwood-4.jpg)\n\n![](/images/sketchbook-whiskey-row.png)\n",
