Darmera is an art studio dedicated to the natural world and community. \n\nWe will open our doors May 4, 2024. [**Sign-up**](https://www.darmera.studio/) for our newsletter containing information about gallery shows, classes, workshops, and events. \n\nDarmera has three main spaces. The gallery space is in the front facing Dunsmuir Ave. The middle space is a classroom for the various [**art classes and retreats**](https://www.darmera.studio/classes) we will be hosting. The back warehouse space is for our art studios. \n\nWe have been working diligently on the remodel every weekend. Enjoy a few images of the process below you should also follow us on Instagram -  [**@darmera.studio**](https://www.instagram.com/darmera.studio/) for the entire remodel journey.\n\n\n<p align=\"left\">\n  <img src=\"/images/construction.jpeg\" alt=\"wall construction\" height=\"300\"/>\n</p>\n\nFraming out one of the gallery walls.\n\n<p align=\"left\">\n  <img src=\"/images/cody-painting-classroom.jpg\" alt=\"Cody painting the classroom with primer\" height=\"300\"/>\n</p>\n\nCody adding the last layer of primer coat to the classroom. \n\n<p align=\"left\">\n  <img src=\"/images/DarmeraStudioBuild-milling.png\" alt=\"milling, lumber, wood drying\" height=\"300\"/>\n</p>\n\nDavis milling a [Sugar Pine](/posts/2022-04-15-sugar-pine-trail-run/) log for trim and studio benches. Just look at the beautiful stack of wood drying in the back studio warehouse space. The beams in the foreground were milled by Davis a few years ago. We are using them as a post and a bench in the gallery.\n\n<p align=\"left\">\n  <img src=\"/images/post-close-up.jpeg\" alt=\"milled and weathered post\" height=\"300\"/>\n</p>\n\nClose-up of the milled post. \n",
