This race year of the [Headwaters Trail Run Race](https://www.headwaterstrailruns.net/) was special for me. Not only did I train hard for the race, but I also got commissioned to make the poster! The poster features the diversity of pine cones that are present throughout the Headwaters course. The cones are arranged in the pyramid shape representing the relative elevation band the species inhabit as you go from Lake Siskiyou 3,185 ft (971 m) to the summit of Mt. Eddy 9,037 ft (2,754 m).

From top to bottom, left to right in the image:

1) White Bark Pine (*Pinus albicaulis*)
2) Shasta Red Fir (*Abies magnifica var. shastensis*)
3) Foxtail Pine (*Pinus balfouriana*)
4) Western White Pine (*Pinus monticola*)
5) Lodgepole Pine (*Pinus contorta*)
6) Incense Cedar (*Calocedrus decurrens*)
7) Jeffery Pine (*Pinus jeffreyi*)
8) Pacific Yew (*Taxus brevifolia*)
9) White Fir (*Abies concolor var. lowiana*)
10) Knobcone Pine (*Pinus attenuata*)
11) Port Orford Cedar (*Chamaecyparis lawsoniana*)
12) Douglas Fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*)
13) Ponderosa Pine (*Pinus ponderosa*)
14) Sugar Pine (*Pinus lambertiana*)

The race has over 8000 ft (~2400 m) of elevation gain and loss. The weather was significantly cooler than previous years. The top of Mt. Eddy was windy and snowy in June. I am really happy with my effort *6:21:01*. I beat the course record from previous years by 9 minutes! However, the field was completely stacked! 8th overall out of ~90 entrants. I will take it! The last time I ran the race I also had a blast. Read about it in this post: [Headwaters Run](/posts/2022-07-01-headwaters/).
