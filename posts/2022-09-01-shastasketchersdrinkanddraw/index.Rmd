I have been meeting up with [Dustin Bonivert](https://dustinbonivert.com/) at least once a week to do some live sketching, chat about art process, and taste some micro-brews. We decided to make our meet-ups a community event once a month hosted at a few businesses in town that sell craft beer. To find out more about upcoming events please visit our group at [Shasta Sketchers](https://www.shastasketchers.com/).

If you like my sketches you can check out the [sketchbook section](https://www.codymarkelz.art/sketchbook) of my art [portfolio website](https://www.codymarkelz.art/) or follow me on instagram [codymarkelz](https://www.instagram.com/codymarkelz/).

I put together a flier based on some of the live sketches I did at these businesses.
