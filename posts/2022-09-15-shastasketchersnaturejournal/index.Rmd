Our first Drink and Draw event was a success! We are going to continue this once a month. Additionally, there was some interest in a [Nature Journaling Club](https://www.shastasketchers.com/nature) Meet-up. To find out more about upcoming events please visit our website at [Shasta Sketchers](https://www.shastasketchers.com/). We will start hosting outdoor sketching meet-ups in the spring of 2023.
