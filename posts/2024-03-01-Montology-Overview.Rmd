[Montology Studios](https://www.montology.studio/) creates illustrated [Zines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine) and media around the theme of mountains and culture. Think of this Zine as a cross between National Geographic, punk rock, adventure, natural history and data science. Each zine has a specific sub-theme. Some previous themes have been [trail running](https://www.codymarkelz.com/#category=trail%20run), [fire ecology](https://www.codymarkelz.com/#category=fire), [adventure vans](https://www.codymarkelz.com/#category=van), and frugality.

My first larger Zine issues (40+ pages) are collected illustrated monthly journal entries. The first two issues cover the periods between **August 2021-July 2022** and **August 2022-July 2023**. These first two issues will be available to ship mid-April. 

In addition, four series that will be published quarterly for 2024. The 2024 schedule for sub-themes are Fire Runner Zine (first issue available mid-April), Bicycle Repair Zine (first issue available mid-July), Life by the River Zine (first issue available mid-October), and Primitive Technology (first issue available Late December).
