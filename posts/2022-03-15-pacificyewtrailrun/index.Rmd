I have started checking off all the conifer species that occur in the [Miracle Mile](/posts/gbif-miracle-mile-species/). I recently found some Pacific Yew (*Taxus brevifolia*) on a trail run with a friend. This was also my first post to iNaturalist. A good time to take a look at the data.

Load the libraries.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rinat)
library(tidyverse)
```

Load the data.
```{r, message=FALSE}
TrailRun1 <- read.csv("~/DATA/data/TrailRun_PacYew.csv")
glimpse(TrailRun1)
```

Make a Northern California polygon for iNaturalist, pull in the data and take look.
```{r, message=FALSE}
bounds <- c(40.194, -124.4323, 42.0021, -120)
species <- c("taxus brevifolia")
pacyew_iNat <- get_inat_obs(query = species, bounds = bounds, maxresults = 1000, quality = "research")
dim(pacyew_iNat)
```


I *had* one of the newest observations of this species in the data set. My username is rjcmarkelz.
```{r, message=FALSE}
glimpse(pacyew_iNat)
head(pacyew_iNat$user_login, 10)
```
Here is my image that I uploaded. I had a species confirmation from the community within 12 hours.

Quick map to show all the observations.
```{r, message=FALSE}
maps::map(database = "state", region = "california")
points(TrailRun1[ , c("position_long", "position_lat")], pch = ".", col = "red", cex = 3)
points(pacyew_iNat[ , c("longitude", "latitude")], pch = ".", col = "blue", cex = 3)
```

Make a quick plot to show the overlay of the run data and the coordinates of the image I took shown as a red dot.
```{r, message=FALSE}
tr_plot1 <- ggplot(TrailRun1, aes(x = position_long, y = position_lat)) +
                    coord_quickmap() + geom_point() +
                    ylab("Latitude") + xlab("Longitude") + 
                 geom_point(aes(x=-122.1683, y=41.120),color="red", size = 5)
tr_plot1   
```
