I participated, lead some sessions, and did some live sketchnote taking at [ImageXD-2023](https://academicdatascience.org/adsa-meetings/imagexd-2023/). Below is the write-up I did for BIDS. If you are interested in sketchnotes, checkout my [sketchnote portfolio](https://www.codymarkelz.art/sketchnotes). 

Researchers from across domains (XD) that use imaging data participated in ImageXD 2023. The two day workshop brought together imaging experts from diverse fields such as medical, biodiversity, machine learning, and software development. Each day had a blend of talks in the morning with "unconference" breakout working groups that were decided daily based on overlapping interests and questions formed and posted as part of a community question board.

Below are some live sketchnotes of the event that I captured:
