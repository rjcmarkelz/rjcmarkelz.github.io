A breakdown of the hours for 2025. This is part of a much larger series of 5 year projects that you can read about [here](/posts/2024-11-15-5YearGoals.html).


I proportionally scaled the space devoted to each goal on the page based on the number of hours for each. I think that doing it this way makes it visual how much time we should be spending sleeping :). It also reflects priorities with the base physiological and personal needs along with my relationship with Caryn, then and only then do the other projects get additional time. All of these projects have significant time buffers built into them. As an example, I rarely sleep 9 hours, but when I am completely worked from exercise I do. Another way to build in a buffer is that I am not accounting for overlaps even though I typically do overlap projects. For example, Caryn and I will be going for a long gravel ride today. This ride is scouting for a local gravel guide zine we are putting together. This touches on both exercise and planet, but I am not counting on that happening all the time.

I want to not feel time stress this year. I am much more creative when I am not time crunched in multiple aspects of life. This happens with external demands, so I build in a lot of extra buffer. A single deadline is enhanced when I have time buffers for everything else. If I have extra time to sit around for some reason, I sketch or write in my EDC sketchbook. All is well.

The projects this year are continuations of this year, but they are about going much deeper on some topics and finishing up some other ones that I now feel confident in the skillset to do it right (e.g. comics). The other thing I remind myself is that with all of these projects built on top of my personal and relationship base are super low stakes. THE STAKES ARE LOW. I want to do them because I think they are cool and I want to learn new things.
