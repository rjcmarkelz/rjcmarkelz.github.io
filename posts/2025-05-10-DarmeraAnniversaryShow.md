# Happy Anniversary Darmera

Darmera Studio is celebrating our one-year anniversary for May 2025! We're grateful to everyone who has taken a class, come to a workshop, or visited the gallery - you've made this possible! 

Davis Elliott and I had our Anniversary Show opening on Saturday, May 10th, from 4–8 pm. We curated a small-format show featuring techniques we teach in our classes and workshops. There was a great turnout and we sold a number of pieces! The show runs until June 7th.
