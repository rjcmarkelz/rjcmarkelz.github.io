Data Science by Design (DSxD) Reconnect Meeting Sketchnote

This fall, [Data Science by Design (DSxD)](https://datasciencebydesign.org/) hosted a [Reconnect Meet-Up](https://datasciencebydesign.org/events) for previous participants of other meetings to get together again. The DSxD community is really diverse in interest and background. Since the first DSxD creator conference this has been one of my favorite online communities to interact with (mostly through Slack). There is always something interesting being shared there and I recently started attending the DSxD book club. 

The sketchnote represents many of the major ideas discussed during the reconnect event. The illustration is wide ranging because DSxD topics and participants are wide ranging. The portion in the bottom left corner was my favorite. The idea was to map data and sketch with it using all of our senses. This section was led by multi-talented [Max Graze](https://datagrazing.com/). Overall, I really like being a part of such a delightful and creative community.
