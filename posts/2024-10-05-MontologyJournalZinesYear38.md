[Montology Studios](https://www.montology.studio/) creates illustrated [Zines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine) and media around the theme of mountains and culture. Think of this Zine as a cross between National Geographic, punk rock, adventure, natural history and data science.

My first larger Zine issues (40+ pages) are collected illustrated monthly journal entries. 

This issue covers **Year 38- August 2022-2023**. The other two published issues cover the periods between [**Year 37- August 2021-July 2022**](/posts/2024-03-01-Montology-Overview.html) and [**Year 39- August 2023-July 2024**](/posts/2024-10-05-MontologyJournalZinesYear39.html).
