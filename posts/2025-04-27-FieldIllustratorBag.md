# I designed a field illustration bag! 

I collaborated with with the incredibly talented Zach Pheiffer-Hansen over at [Sovyrn](https://www.sovyrn69.com/online-store) in Mount Shasta to bring this project to life.

I wanted a lightweight water resistant field illustration bag that would fit a 6x9 inch sketchbook and my supplies. I sent some sketches and reference images over to Zach and then joined him in his studio one evening to make the bag. You can see the entire process illustrated in the sketchnote above.

You can order one for $79 directly from [Sovyrn](https://www.sovyrn69.com/online-store/6x9-Field-Illustrator-Bag-Black-Blue-p743478699). Zach can also do some custom colors. Make sure to reach out to him! 

Unique features of this bag are:
- custom size to fit 6x9 sketchbooks/journals without a lot of wiggle room
- comfortable to wear while out in the field all day
- a way to attach to the front of a bike for bikesketching adventures
- a removable and velcro quick access pouch for common pencil, pen, waterbrush
- light weight water resistant material

This was an incredibly fun project. Zach went from my ideas to a finished bag prototype with exact patterns over the course of an evening. This bag lives on my body except when I am sleeping. Or maybe I sleep with it on too. ;)
