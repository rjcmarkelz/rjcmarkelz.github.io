# Concept
For the second iteration of the ArtScienceHack in 2016, we decided to bring our art, design, science, engineering, and data skills together to work on a single project for 48 hours. We had very minimal exposure to the [processing language](https://processing.org/) prior to starting this, but I had experience building things in many other languages. Processing is a good first language to learn for designers and artists so we started there. 


Read more about the first ArtScienceHack [here](/posts/2015-01-01-ArtScienceHack.html). 

# Goals
Rapidly learn the basics of processing and make an interactive model of plant growth that takes human movement as input to the model.

# Outcomes
Overall the hackathon was a success. We had an interactive model of plant growth that had a fundamental trade-off function built in. This trade-off is visualized as the root:shoot ratio using hand control through the hacked xbox connect controller.
