[My first published art work](https://datasciencebydesign.org/blog/fire-zine-ecosystems-and-human-scales) came out earlier this month in the Data Science by Design (DSxD) anthology titled "Our Environment."

The zine is titled- Fire Zine: Ecosystems and Human Scales. I collaborated with Jackie Dean, an Alaskan Fire Scientist on a short fire zine examining the differences between Alaskan and California ecosystems, as well as looking at fire from a human scale up to the ecosystem scale. We really had to compress our ideas into the 5 pages, but I think we came up with some cool visuals. I assembled everything and did the layouts of the information. I had a great time working on this project from concept to physical publication. 

You can order a printed version of the DSxD Anthology [here](https://datasciencebydesign.org/book-2). Or if you want to check out the individual sections that are released slowly over time, you can see them on the DSxD blog [here](https://datasciencebydesign.org/blog/).
