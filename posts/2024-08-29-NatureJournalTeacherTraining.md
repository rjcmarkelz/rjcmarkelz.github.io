I started the [Mount Shasta Nature Journaling Club](https://www.shastasketchers.com/nature) a few years ago, but we are now getting back into the groove of offering regular meet-ups. Darmera Studios started offering weekly donations based meet-ups at for [Nature Journaling every Sunday from 3:30-5:30](https://www.darmera.studio/classes/p/guided-nature-journaling-session-4-hours). It has been really fun to focus on developing curiosity based methods that incorperate pictures, words and numbers. 

To get even better at teaching ecology/plant biology, I am enrolled in the [Wild Wonder Foundation's Nature Journaling Teacher Training Program](https://www.wildwonder.org/nature-journaling-educator). All of my notes from the program (like the rubric sketchnote above), will be available for a free download or a few dollars to have a physical copy to offset printing costs.

As part of the program I am developing some activities that are custom to the Mount Shasta/Dunsmuir/Weed/McCloud bioregion relating to fire, fire recovery, and rare plants. 

More to come in the upcoming posts!
