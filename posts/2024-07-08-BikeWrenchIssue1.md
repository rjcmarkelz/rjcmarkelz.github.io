I have a lifelong passion for riding and wrenching on bicycles. This zine series documents my journey from amateur to professional bicycle mechanic to repair shop owner: [Montology Bicycle Repair](https://www.montology.studio/bicycle-repair).

I have a scientific research background in quantitative biology and statistical modeling biological processes. I use a scientific lens to try understanding how components work through physics and how to develop mathematical models of how the components work in isolation and together as a larger system. This issue follows the lessons that are taught at the [United Bicycle Institute](https://bikeschool.com/) Professional Bike Mechanic Class. There are scientific principles underlying all of the lessons contained in this class, but the class was much more hands on. This series will bounce back and forth between theory and application. You as the reader will be able to follow along my development as a bicycle mechanic and working through the underlying physics, mechanical engineering and design thinking principles around bicycles.

[Montology Studios](https://www.montology.studio/) creates illustrated [Zines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine) and media around the theme of mountains and culture. Think of this Zine as a cross between National Geographic, punk rock, adventure, natural history and data science. Each zine has a specific sub-theme. Some previous themes have been [trail running](https://www.codymarkelz.com/#category=trail%20run), [fire ecology](https://www.codymarkelz.com/#category=fire), [adventure vans](https://www.codymarkelz.com/#category=van), and frugality.
