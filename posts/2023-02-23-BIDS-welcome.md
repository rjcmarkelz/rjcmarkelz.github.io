SDH Hall Sketch


[**Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)**](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) finally moved into our new space in [Sutardja Dai Hall](https://citris-uc.org/about/sutardja-dai-hall/) on the UC Berkeley campus. I designed this flier for our welcome event featuring an illustration of SDH. I knew immediately that I wanted to sketch this great building, but did not know it would become part of a flier! 

The welcome event was great. I met a lot of really interesting people and struck up some collaborations to visualize some research through illustrations and sketchnotes! I am really excited about this new opportunity to apply my love for learning, illustration and data visualization towards science communications of the cool projects that are going on at BIDS.
