Mount Shasta from Gray Butte - Green Red Colorblind Trail Run- July 2025
	
Sam Merano and I did an adventure day to start at the Horse Camp Trail Head, summiting Green Butte, Red Butte, and then Gray Butte in one big loop back to Horse Camp. Most of the snow had melted, but we got some good glissading down the steep sections off Green Butte into Old Ski Bowl. We stopped to fill up our water at a spring before heading over to Red Butte.

Red Butte was the most adventurous part of the run because neither of us knew the trail-less route around the steep faces. We contoured around and found a spot that looked climbable. We left our running poles and climbed up a gully that had some trees growing in it. This was not ideal! The gully led up to a false summit. We eventually wandered around on the top of the butte and found the actual summit. Great views!

We found a less treacherous way down on the southeast side of Red Butte. We contoured around to collect our poles before overlanding towards Gray Butte. Once we met up with the main Gray Butte Trail, the rest of the trip was on trails we were familiar with. We summited Gray Butte and then headed back down and back up to Old Ski Bowl to take the Snow Bunny Trail back to the Bunny Flat Trailhead.
My watch glitched a little because I hit stop with my wrist while climbing up the gully on Red Butte, but ~25 km, 5 hours, 1600 m gain/loss all above 2,130 m in elevation. A great day out!
