A quick digital illustration of my small and medium sized travel/adventure art sketch kits. The top row is the small kit that fits into a Patagonia Black Hole fanny pack. The middle/bottom rows make up my medium kit. My small kit technically fits inside also, but it is its own kit. I always have some form of sketchbook with me when out and about. #dailysketching
