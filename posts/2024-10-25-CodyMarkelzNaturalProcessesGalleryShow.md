I will be doing a gallery show that opens Saturday November 9th at Darmera Gallery in Dunsmuir, CA. 
The show comes out of a desire to make physical manifestations of some of the digital art that I created over the past few years. I will write more about the process details with examples after the show opens, but the show focuses on a series of pinecone illustrations I did that are associated with various blog posts. If you are a reader of the blog, you will recognize the shapes and physical versions of these images. Nature is a common theme in my art and this show is very much about the process of making that art. Hence the show title: Natural Processes.
